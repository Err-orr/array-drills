# Questions
1. How would you modify the code to display the tasks in a user-friendly format rather than just printing them directly?

I can write comments or explain what's happening when code is being printed to the user.


2. For question 8, Can you think of a more efficient way to correct the misspelled technology without manually modifying the array?

Change the index value to the new corrected value and replace it in the array.

3. For question 15, How would you modify the method to determine if Friday was a busy night based on a specific threshold of tables served?

I would add all the numbers and based on the numbers, there would be an explanation saying if it's busy or not depending on the size of the number so lower, it would say not busy and higher it would say it's getting busy.
